## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-27

Two-tier architecture: generic Git Flow commands at user-level, project-specific overrides at project-level.

### Added

- **Two-tier command architecture** — generic `/feature`, `/release`, `/hotfix`, `/finish`, `/flow-status` commands at `~/.claude/commands/` with project-specific overrides in `.claude/commands/`
- **`scripts/git-flow-status.sh`** — comprehensive diagnostic script with `--json` output for agent consumption
- **`scripts/git-flow-finish.sh`** — hook-aware branch finish script that handles merge, tag, push, and cleanup
- **Plugin manifest** — `plugin-manifest.json` for plugin assembly and distribution via `skill-publishing`

### Changed

- **SKILL.md** — rewritten for two-tier architecture with generic commands, override system, and project-specific customization guide
- **Commands** — moved from project-level to user-level with dynamic context injection

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-22

Initial release.

### Included

- **SKILL.md** — Git Flow branching model reference with merge targets, conventions, and branch naming
